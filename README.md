# paxdb-issues
🧩 Welcome to the PaxDb Issue Tracker — the central place to report, discuss, and track issues related to PaxDb, the Protein Abundance Database.

Here is the place to submit:
## request to re-process proteomics data from ProteomeXchange
- File name annotation
```
_CTRL_, control, 4
_SULFUR_, sulfur_treatment, 4
Enzyme: trypsin
Acquisition: DDA
```
The above example annoates an experiment, consisting of 8 samples, e.g. 
```
202108_CTRL_1
202108_CTRL_2
202108_CTRL_3
202108_CTRL_4
202108_SULFUR_1
202108_SULFUR_2
202108_SULFUR_3
202108_SULFUR_4
```
The group distinguishing file name snippets are \_CTRL\_ and \_SULFUR\_
And the experiment uses tryptic digestion and DDA acquisition mode.

You can find [data_request_template.txt](data request template) but it is recommended to submit the data request issue through the [https://pax-db.org/request](PaxDb web interface).

## report of data error or request update on genome annotation / name
